        //(pick3) Create a pick 3 lottery helper program to select a set of lottery numbers for the user. The program should randomly pick three single-digit numbers from "0" to "9" and display them on the screen. Duplicate numbers are allowed. It should also calculate and display the "sum it up" value by adding the three numbers together.
        //Use number1= rand() % (max - min + 1) + min; with 0 as the min and 9 as the max for this problem. The following example code picks and displays a number from 1 to 100.
        //#include <iostream>.
        //#include <cstdlib>
        //#include <ctime>
        //int main()
        //{
        //int number1;
        //srand(time(0));
        ////randomize the number generation
        //number1 = rand() % 100  + 1;
        //cout << "The computer picked number " << number1;
        //return 0;
        //}
        //10 points - correct use of rand function
        //10 points - correct output
